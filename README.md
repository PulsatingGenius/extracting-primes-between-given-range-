# extracting-primes-between-given-range-
i used python to extract primes between numbers like for say if we want to get prime numbers between 1-10 we will just look for it but what if the range is big then it would be a little tough to look for each and every prime one by one.

 for example
get_primes(1,30)

- [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
